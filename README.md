RISCV Sail Model
================

This repository contains a model of the RISCV architecture written in
[Sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/). It used to be contained
in the [Sail repository](https://github.com/rems-project/sail).

It currently defines enough of RV32IMAC and RV64IMAC to boot a
conventional OS with a terminal output device.  The model specifies
assembly language formats of the instructions, the corresponding
encoders and decoders, and the instruction semantics.
The current status of its
coverage of the prose RISC-V specification is summarized
[here](doc/Status.md).
A [reading guide](doc/ReadingGuide.md) to the model is provided in the
[doc/](doc/) subdirectory, along with a guide on [how to
extend](doc/ExtendingGuide.md) the model. 


Latex definitions can be generated from the model that are suitable
for inclusion in reference documentation.  Drafts of the RISC-V
[unprivileged](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/blob/sail/release/riscv-spec-sail-draft-alpha2.pdf)
and [privileged](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/blob/sail/release/riscv-privileged-sail-draft-alpha2.pdf)
specifications that include the Sail formal definitions are available
in the sail branch of this [risc-v-isa-manual repository](https://github.com/rems-project/riscv-isa-manual/tree/sail).

This is one of [several formal models](https://github.com/riscv/ISA_Formal_Spec_Public_Review/blob/master/comparison_table.md) compared within the 
[RISC-V ISA Formal Spec Public Review](https://github.com/riscv/ISA_Formal_Spec_Public_Review).

```

Simulators
----------

The files in the OCaml and C emulator directories implement ELF loading and the
platform devices, define the physical memory map, and use command-line
options to select implementation-specific ISA choices.

Provers
-------

The files under `handwritten_support` provide library definitions for
Coq, Isabelle and HOL4.

Building the model
------------------

Install Sail [via
Opam](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/wiki/OPAMInstall), or build Sail
from source and have `SAIL_DIR` in your environment pointing to its
top-level directory.

```
$ make
```
will build the 64-bit OCaml simulator in
`ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_RV64`, the C simulator in
`c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV64`, the Isabelle model in
`generated_definitions/isabelle/RV64/Riscv.thy`, the Coq model in
`generated_definitions/coq/RV64/riscv.v`, and the HOL4 model in
`generated_definitions/hol4/RV64/riscvScript.sml`.

One can build either the RV32 or the RV64 model by specifying
`ARCH=RV32` or `ARCH=RV64` on the `make` line, and using the matching
target suffix.  RV64 is built by default, but the RV32 model can be
built using:

```
$ ARCH=RV32 make
```

which creates the 32-bit OCaml simulator in
`ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_RV32`, and the C simulator in
`c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV32`, and the prover models in the
corresponding `RV32` subdirectories.

The Makefile targets `riscv_isa_build`, `riscv_coq_build`, and
`riscv_hol_build` invoke the respective prover to process the
definitions.  We have tested Isabelle 2018, Coq 8.8.1, and HOL4
Kananaskis-12.  When building these targets, please make sure the
corresponding prover libraries in the Sail directory
(`$SAIL_DIR/lib/$prover`) are up-to-date and built, e.g. by running
`make` in those directories.

Executing test binaries
-----------------------

The C and OCaml simulators can be used to execute small test binaries.  The
OCaml simulator depends on the Device Tree Compiler package, which can be
installed in Ubuntu with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler
```

Then, you can run test binaries:


```
$ ./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_<arch>  <elf-file>
$ ./c_emulator/riscv_sim_<arch> <elf-file>
```

A suite of RV32 and RV64 test programs derived from the
[`riscv-tests`](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) test-suite is
included under [test/riscv-tests/](test/riscv-tests/).  The test-suite
can be run using `test/run_tests.sh`.

Configuring platform options
----------------------------

Some information on additional configuration options for each
simulator is available from `./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim_<arch>
-h` and `./c_emulator/riscv_sim_<arch> -h`.

Some useful options are: configuring whether misaligned accesses trap
(`--enable-misaligned` for C and `-enable-misaligned` for OCaml), and
whether page-table walks update PTE bits (`--enable-dirty-update` for C
and `-enable-dirty-update` for OCaml).

Booting OS images
-----------------

For booting operating system images, see the information under the
[os-boot/](os-boot/) subdirectory.
