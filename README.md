RISCV Sail Model
================

This repository contains a model of the RISCV architecture written in
[Sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/). It used to be contained
in the [Sail repository](https://github.com/rems-project/sail).

It currently implements enough of RV64IMAC to boot a conventional OS
with a terminal output device.  Work on a 32-bit model is ongoing.
The model specifies assembly language formats of the instructions,
the corresponding encoders and decoders, and the instruction semantics.

Documentation
-------------

A [reading guide](doc/ReadingGuide.md) to the model is provided in the
[doc/](doc/) subdirectory, along with a guide on [how to
extend](doc/ExtendingGuide.md) the model.

Simulators
----------

The files in the OCaml and C simulators implement ELF-loading and the
platform devices, define the physical memory map, and use command-line
options to select implementation-specific ISA choices.

Building the model
------------------

Install Sail via Opam, or build Sail from source and have SAIL_DIR in
your environment pointing to its top-level directory.

```
$ make
```
will build the OCaml simulator in `ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim`, the C simulator in
`c_emulator/riscv_sim`, the Isabelle model in `generated_definitions/isabelle/Riscv.thy`, the Coq
model in `generated_definitions/coq/riscv.v`, and the HOL4 model in
`generated_definitions/hol4/riscvScript.sml`.

The Makefile targets `riscv_isa_build`, `riscv_coq_build`, and
`riscv_hol_build` invoke the respective prover to process the definitions.  We
have tested Isabelle 2018, Coq 8.8.1, and HOL4 Kananaskis-12.

Executing test binaries
-----------------------

The C and OCaml simulators can be used to execute small test RV64 binaries.

```
$ ./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim  <elf-file>
$ ./c_emulator/riscv_sim <elf-file>
```
Some information on additional configuration options for each simulator is available
from `./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim -h` and `./c_emulator/riscv_sim -h`.

Booting Linux with the C backend
--------------------------------

The C model needs an ELF-version of the BBL (Berkeley-Boot-Loader)
that contains the Linux kernel as an embedded payload.  It also needs
a DTB (device-tree blob) file describing the platform (say in the file
`spike.dtb`).  Once those are available (see below for suggestions),
the model should be run as:

```
$ ./c_emulator/riscv_sim -t console.log -b spike.dtb bbl > execution-trace.log 2>&1 &
$ tail -f console.log
```
The `console.log` file contains the console boot messages. For maximum
performance and benchmarking a model without any execution tracing is
available on the optimize branch (`git checkout optimize`) of this
repository. This currently requires the latest Sail built from source.

Booting Linux with the OCaml backend
------------------------------------

The OCaml model only needs the ELF-version of the BBL, since it can generate its
own DTB.
```
$ ./ocaml_emulator/riscv_ocaml_sim bbl > execution-trace.log 2> console.log
```

Generating input files for Linux boot
-------------------------------------

One could directly build Linux and the toolchain using
`https://github.com/sifive/freedom-u-sdk`.  The built `bbl`
will be available in `./work/riscv-pk/bbl`.  You will need to configure
a kernel that can be booted on Spike; in particular, it should be
configured to use the HTIF console.

The DTB can be generated using Spike and the DeviceTree compiler
`dtc` as:

```
spike --dump-dts . | dtc > spike.dtb
```

(The '.' above is to work around a minor Spike bug and may not be
needed in future Spike versions.)

Caveats for OS boot
-------------------

- Some OS toolchains generate obsolete LR/SC instructions with now
  illegal combinations of `.aq` and `.rl` flags.  You can work-around
  this by changing `riscv_mem.sail` to accept these flags.

- One needs to manually ensure that the DTB used for the C model
  accurately describes the physical memory map implemented in the C
  platform.  This will not be needed once the C model can generate its
  own DTB.
